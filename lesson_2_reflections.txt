Working area--> Staging area--> Repository
When we initialize a repository by using git init command a .git file is created and we can use the git status command to check the current status of the repository we are working with.
git init # create a new .git commit file
git status # to get status of the current repository
git add [file] # used to add files to the staging area , to make them ready to be commited
git reset [file] # re,ove file from staging area
git commit -m "Commit message"
% git commit not working as intended
% git commit learned to used it needed to close all the application window of sublime 3
git commit # - use to add commit using a text editor
